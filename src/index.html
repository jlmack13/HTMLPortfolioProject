    <h3>Learn More About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a fairly new developer (at least full time and official). Prior to this I was a student assistant
      to the web development team that I am now working on full time. I came to the development game
      a little late, I originally went to school for and got a Bachelor's in English. One
      of the best things about development, and the tech industry in general, is that people from a wide variety of
      fields can learn tech skills and find a place here. I am passionate about creating websites, learning to code,
      playing video games, and reading and writing books. At the moment, I enjoy coding in JavaScript, AngularJS, and C#.</p>
